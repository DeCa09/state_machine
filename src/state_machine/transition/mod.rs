use crate::state_machine::{state::State, StateMachine};

/// A trait that defines the ability of a state machine to transition from one state to another.
///
/// The `Transition` trait extends the `StateMachine` trait, allowing a state machine to move from
/// one state of type `T` to a new state of type `U`. This trait is generic over the states `T` and `U`,
/// which must both implement the `State` trait. The trait also requires the current state machine to
/// implement `StateMachine<T>`.
///
/// # Associated Types
///
/// - `NewStateMachine`: Represents the type of the state machine after the transition has been performed.
///   This type must implement the `StateMachine<U>` trait, ensuring the state machine is valid in the new state.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Implementors of this trait must handle potential errors that could occur during state transitions.
/// These errors can occur due to several reasons:
/// - Attempting to transition to a state that is not defined in the state machine.
/// - Incompatibilities between the data formats of the current state and the new state.
/// - Logical errors in the state transition logic, such as invalid conditions for transitioning.
///
pub trait Transition<T: State, U: State>: StateMachine<T> {
    /// The type of the state machine after transitioning to the new state.
    ///
    /// This type represents the state machine in its new state. It must implement the `StateMachine<U>` trait,
    /// which ensures that it correctly represents a state machine capable of handling the state `U`.

    /// Transitions the state machine to the next state.
    ///
    /// This method performs the transition from the current state `T` to the new state `U`, updating
    /// the state machine accordingly. The method returns a result that contains the updated state machine
    /// in the new state or an error message if the transition fails.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// - `Ok(NewStateMachine)`: The updated state machine in the new state.
    /// - `Err(&'static str)`: An error message indicating the reason for the failed transition.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Errors can occur for various reasons, including but not limited to:
    /// - The transition is not defined between the current state and the target state.
    /// - Incompatible data or invalid conditions prevent a successful transition.
